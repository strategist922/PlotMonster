# PlotMonster
Chia Plotter with the intention to fill up the remaining space on a drive starting at the biggest allowed k size and scaling down from there to fill the void.

This is written in C# in Ubuntu.  This needs a couple change to work in Windows since the process is executed a bit differently.  

Please check the project for more details on upcoming changes @ https://github.com/users/jacoblroberts/projects/1

Participation is welcomed.  Then end goal is to have a pluggable plot service where GUI's can be attached when visualization is needed.  I would like this to be a full featured Chia plot manager that will detect new destination drives and fill them up.

Here is an example of 6 k34 plots being created in parallel
